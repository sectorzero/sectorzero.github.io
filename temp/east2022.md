## Trip Log

- Day 1, Wed, 09/21
  - Went to Goodwill, finished laundry, final cleaning and pre-car pack by 1 PM. Thought I'll leave early and cut the r70mi dist for original day 1. Started final packing of car and got overwhelmed. Finished and left at 6.30 PM. Was tired. 
  - Stopped at Ellensburg for Tea and Subway. Thought I'll go to Moses Lake, WA and get a hotel. The hotel in Moses Lake quoted me 120 instead of 110 and I left thinking I'll reach Spokane, WA as I was not tired. But hotel rates spiked in Spokane, WA on checking. So I thought will just sleep in a rest area for the night. Stopped at the first interstate rest area for the night. fell asleep, but woke up late as uncomfortable. 
- Day 2, Thu, 09/22
  - Moved to the next rest area at four AM and slept till 6.30. Woke up, freshened up, did yoga and left. Had breakfast in Spokane, WA. The rest was shitty called Madelline's French Cafe. They charged 25 for a shitty bf of 5 bucks. Saw Spokane, WA for a bit and started.
  - It got rainy after Coeur D Alene, ID, stopped in MT for a veggie burger and huckleberry shake. The shake was shitty as too sweet. reached Nine Pipes Lodge by 5. Ate dinner. Everything was good. Slept.
  - I got an engine light on somewhere in MT. I was a bit worried. I thought will get it checked in MT.
- Day 3, Fri, 09/23  
  - Woke up, went for a walk in the Nine Pipes Wr in front of the hotel. It was great. I saw a golden eagle fly by.
  - Bf was provided in the hotel, got ready and re-packed the car with a calm mind. Now everything fit well with enough space for shamans stuff. I left at 11.
  - Was thinking of getting the engine light checked in a Ford at Missoula or Butte or Bozeman. Somewhere I stopped at a rest area and accelerated out of the on-ramp. The light went away. I was releived.
  - reached butte, mt for lunch. It is the second shittiet town I saw on the way. Everthing closed at 3 and lots of shitty ppl. I got a sandwich in a closing shop, ate in a shitty park and left.
  - I saw an exit fo4 Missou4i Headwate4s and took it. Glad I did. It is the headwate4s of the Missou4i which sta4ts off at a confluence. I spent some time the4e. It was wonde4ful and peaceful. I will meet the Missou4i again downst4eam.
  - reached bozeman by 5. shaman said first leg delayed and was not sure to make the connection. Luckily with 20 mins to go, shaman had made the connection.
  - Got dinner packed in a thai restauarant and walked and biked in a neighbohood park and ate dinner partially
  - picked up shaman from the bozeman airport. There was a huge jam due to the shitty arrival design, but was able to pick him up from parking area and we ate dinner near tables at a grocery store and left at 10 pm. We reached Joliet, MT by midnight. 
  - room in Joleit, was really really good. It was a private small setup and really well kept. Slept well
- Day 4, Sat, 09/24
  - Woke up, went for a walk. The town was small and quiet. Was a bit scared to walk. Went to a small stream and back. Started at 9.
  - We drove in the mostly dryscape, to Lovell. Had bf in a small local rest. Absoulutely no restaurants in the way.
  - We left Lovell. I saw the sign for Black Horn Canyon. I thought we should spend time and see it. And I am glad I did. It is one of the most underrated places. It was great.
  - Then we passed on the Big Horn Mountains and then reached Sheridan. The hotel was decent with very nice staff. 
  - We had dinner in a really shitty Nepali wannabe restaurant.
  - Shaman said, we should camp in Devils tower and we thought we will leave early next day and see if we can get a fcfs campspot in the national monument. We decided that the booking for 2 days in the horsethief campground will be kept.
- Day 5, Sun, 09/25
  - Left by 8.30, ate some bf in mcd and reached devils tower nm by 11.30. We were lucky to find lot of campspots and we picked one with shade and view of the devils tower. it was ereally great.
  - We explored the area with some hikes.
  - Evening we went to Joyner ridge for sunset view and just got in time for the light. Wish we were just 10 mins early, but we got just a glimpse at the right light.
  - Night we went to joyner ridge for night sky. there was nobody in the main parking lot and it was newmoon and the night sky was awesome.
  - It was quite cold at night for camping and when i woke up 2 times, saw diff constellations, once Orion in all its splendor
  - one interesting thing was, the restaurant which was least likey and i thought would be full of bikers had a veggie burger with black bean patty. Was really good food with great pie
- Day 6, Mon, 09/26
  - Woke up and packed up camp and we ate in the same restaurant as no choices. Bf was good.
  - We arrived at Crazy horse and saw the sights
  - We came to horsethief campground and we were not sure of the entrance. so we went to mt rushmor3 nm first. I am glad we did. The nm was mediocre with it feeling like going into a US consulate. We quickly made a plan to ditch staying there and go ahead see badlands which was on the way fwd. And booked some hotel.
  - We were glad to see Badlands between 6-7 PM. it was spectacular and wished we had ditched mt rushmore all together and had more time in badlands. 
  - We went to the hotel in Interior, SD. It was the crappy hotel, with some fould smell. the concierge was not friendly and said no rooms to take it or leave. We aired out the room and it was ok. Slept well
- Day 7, Tue, 09/27
  - We woke up early and left sharp by 7.30. It was a long drive along the prairie to Ohama today. No restaurants anywhere along the way.
  - Came to valentine, ne, the time had shifted to CST. We ate some shitty bf in a restaurnt called something else cafe
  - Got some info about Niobara river, saw a viewpoint and left
  - It was mostly flat rolling prairie. Only corn and soybeans. Nothing else
  - Came to Ohama. Hotel was decent and just 4 min from the airpot.
  - Surprise was we found an Indian restaurant which was excellent. Omaha has 22 indian restaurants.
  - Slept.
- Day 8, Wed, 09/28
  - Woke up at r. Dropped shaman off
  - I had another long day ahead with rr0 to hit across the prairie, so left early. Went out to see the Missouri which meeting her again after the headwaters. Its really polluted by the time it raches Omaha.
  - First 300 miles were boring but fast wide roads across the prairie across missouri.
  - Then I stopped in Hannibal, MO to get my first glimpse of the might river. Surpisingly, it is the place of Mark Twain. So the town has all the spots from Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn. I really enjoyed it, but had very little time. I was excited to see the Missisppi for the first time and it marked the end of the prairie and the beggining of the lands of the east.
  - After Hannibal, i crossed over to Illinois state and the drive along the Missisippi was one of the most scenic and most peaceful. The drive goes along the agri plains of the Missisppi. I got to see the river once more in a boat access area.
  - Then surpisinngly I stopped at a state park where the mississpi turns slowly. It was heaven on earth. it was evening, nobody there and it was so a beautiful place. 
  - The drive after that to Alton, IL, is along the Mississpi and its one of the most beautiful sights.
  - Hotel was a bit shitty. I got a 4oom which smelled of smoke. So got it exchanged. Staff was not g4eat.
- Day 9, Thu, 09/29
  - Woke up early and got ready to leave.
  - First visited the great confluence. I had to take a dirt road, unmarked for rour miles. the confluence was spectacular. nobody visits this place, the most signifiocant place. it is all isolated and rejected. I was all alone. Enjoyed the energy at the great confluence.
  - next made my way to the confluence of the Missispi and the Ohio in Cairo, IL. It is an ye-old town, once grand, but now ransacked by time and entropy. The confluence was great. met a lonely nice guy fishing there. the banks are really clayy and need to be careful
  - next made my way to Paducah, KY for the confluence of the Ohio and Tenn rivers. It is a eally beautiful and nice place and sat by the confluence eating Culvers cheese curds. KY is really nice and beautiful. I thought it will be dilapidated wiht poverty. but it is not so. All nice ppl and well kept.
  - next drove to the campsite at Canal Campground. It was really nice on the shores of the lake. I think it is KY Dam. put up my tent and slept for the night. the campground had showers and clean and enjoyed it. campground was full of rv-istas.
- Day 10, Fri, 09/30
