- [Satellite Comm Number (Text) : TODO]()

### Emergency Contact
- Grand Teton National Park (+1-307-739-3309 / +1-307–739​–3399)
- 911 
- Notified People (Trackers)
  - Shaman (+1-814-852-8991)
  - Rishab Animesh (+1-607-793-3515) 
  - Divya (+1-214-228-5356)

### When To Contact Emergency
- We are expected to complete the hike and be back to Laurance Rockefeller Preserve Parking Lot by Friday around 1600. There might be unseen delays. But we should contact back to the trackers by Friday late evening. If you do not hear back from us by late Friday night, you can contact emergency.
- The GPS location is supposed to be live. But if you do not see it progress, it might be that we ran out of battery or have some technical issues. Also it will be turned off at night when we dont move. Other than that we will carry the GPS locator whenever we move. This will give you information where we are and where we were tracked last. In the event this stops logging, please do not over-compensate
- The satellite comm device will have a number where we can send / receive texts. Again give room for delays in receving, sending and device not working.
- The topo-map has our day plans and we will not deviate from the plan for any reason unless extraordinary circumstances. So should be used for emergency information.
