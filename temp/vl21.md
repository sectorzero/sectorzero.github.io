### Vegan Food Definition

This is my goal of Vegan food & lifestyle. The standard defintion of Americans is too lax and does not truly serve it's purpose. This is not for everybody.

- No animal based productions. No dairy, eggs, honey etc. Regular defintion applies.
- Vegan means live sustainbly with the ecosystem. You cannot put your health first. I am not doing this for dieting or health. If the entire system is in balance, you will be in balance.
- Do not substitite x for y. Eg. if you are leaving ice-cream, do not substitute with some another version of ice-cream. The old food exists in the old unsustainable system. You have to build a new system which is entirely differently which fits well with the ecosystem. Eg. I did not susbstitute egg with egg replacements, I switched to moong and lentils. ( Buckminster Fuller principle )
- Do not use fake vegan products like Almond Milk. Some bastard wanted to make money and substituted milk with an exteremely enviornmentally destructive and un-sustainable product call Almond Milk which uses more water, destroys land for forests and kills bees and requires a lot of pesticides. If you are doing something, do it for better trajectory of good. Not like the fake Americans who only want to be vegan for social media.
- Has to be sustainably tasty. Have to innovate things which taste good and can be eaten on a regular basis
- Focusing mostly shifting 'real' Indian diet to vegan variations. India diet, if removed 'dairy', is the most sustainable and healthy diet.
- Priorities in order - Environment, Taste, Health.
