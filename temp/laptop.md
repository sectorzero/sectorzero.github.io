# Assessment of Microsoft Surface Laptop For Development & Personal Use

- Talked to people who use Surface and other laptops for regular development using Windows 10. Surface is a good device, reliable and works well. It is comparable to other brands like Dell XPS and Lenovo Thinkpad. The Dell and Thinkpad might be more customizable, but Surface is a good reliable device.
- In Surface avoid devices which have try to make it behave like a tablet/pad. Pro is a mix of laptop and tablet. Avoid things like these as these don't work too well and more cost is used for making that feature.

# [Surface Laptop 3](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-laptop-3/8vfggh1r94tm?activetab=overview)

Considering all the Surface devices, the Surface Laptop 3 seems to the most simple and effective laptop and has good configurations for development & regular use.

## Options : 

| screen | processor |  ram  |  ssd  | cost(usd) | cost-san(usd) | india-cost(usd) |
| :----- | :-------: | :---: | :---: | :-------: | :-----------: | --------------: |
| 13.5   |  core i7  |  16   |  256  |   1400    |     1150      |              NA |
| 13.5   |  core i5  |   8   |  256  |   1100    |      NA       |              NA |
| 13.5   |  core i5  |   8   |  128  |    NA     |      NA       |            1570 |
| 15     |  AMD 5/7  |  16   |  256  |   1700    |     1550      |              NA |
| 15     |   AMD 5   |   8   |  256  |   1600    |      NA       |            1670 |

For buying in India
- It costs more to buy something of lesser configuration. There is no 16GB RAM option
- There is Surface Laptop 2 which is phased out, which possibly costs less, but at a lower configuration
- Of all the first option for MS discounted price seems best, but not available in India
