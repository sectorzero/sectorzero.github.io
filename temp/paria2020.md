These events happened in unprecendented times. Unprecendeted. A word thrown away at the drop of the hat these days. Unprecedented. Not because human society had not ever seen an epidemic from a bioorganism, but that the masters of this human society had found unprecendented ways to use origanizational methods to control and curb the basic rights of a large volume of humans, that too, by consent. Basic rights of common people to live freely in society was being stripped away and everybody confined into thier home spaces. Ironically the people who were imprisioned by the same societal-laws, set free to roam and run. Yes, unprecedented, in many ways. This story is about trying to live the last slice of life, breathe the last whiff of free air before which all common rights of human beings will be locked away forever.

It all began in early January, cold January, when a group of four friends started to plan for the year's backpacking trip, full of enthusiasm from the previous year's fantastic backpacking trip to the Enchantments. We were all trying to discover where to go this year. Somewhere in the next few weeks, somehere in-between relentless searching and getting frustrated with the permit system imposed on public lands, I found this jewel of place called Paria Canyon. This too was under a tight leash of permits which had to be contested for and won. Without having to dissapoint the group, I told them that I would reveal the place, if I was able to obtain the permits.

It was not until the beginning of Feb, was I able to contest for these permits. And a nice crisp day in March, I won the permits for our group for a trip in May. Paria Canyon, is subject to flash floods and extreme desert climate. So the favourable season to travel to this place was either in April-May or Sep-Oct. I was able to obtain permits for the required 5 days and which spanned the weekend as some friends in the group would want to reduce the number of thier days they have to apply for leave. The biggest hurdle, which I thought was the biggest at that moment, was crossed. I was really excited that day. So exited was I, that I was shooting off some really difficult yoga moves and in one a flash during a crow-pose balance, I felt spine and torso feel stripped apart and fell to the floor. I had minimized the damage, but it was so bad, I wasn't sure if I could walk properly anymore. My wife was set to leave to India the following week and she was worried. That whole week, I could not walk properly and I could not sit. I was sure I had damaged some spinal discs and it could not have come at this moment.

Adding to this, I soon discovered all the other three in the group were not able to make it to the trip due to some or the other constraints they had. Very quickly, this was turing into dust. I kept positive and focussed on the problems on hand. I had to try and fix my back and physical ability to make this trip and then try and possibly find other people who could join me. There was a cloudy mood hovering over this. For the first, I saw a doctor, got some appointments with a physical therapist, switched to standing at my desk. It was slow, but soon after 3-4 weeks of physical therapy sessions, there was light at the end of the tunnel and I could consciously feel, I that I would be back in physical shape for this trip. I was able to start running slowly after 4 weeks, kept at my physical therapy exercises and things were looking up. On the other front, I shot out to everybody I knew to possibly join or have any of thier friends who were interested to make this trip. And I would wait.
