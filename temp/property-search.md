# Property Requirements

## What is the purpose of property :
- Primary living residence
- Have space to growing plants, vegetable and fruits. Maybe have some bees. Should be sorrounded by natural growth trees and vegetation. NOT for animal raising.
- Develop the land into a permaculture type land

## Few things what is important to me
- Land, Sorrounding Aspects and Location are much more imporant and higher priority than the actual house or built up space. 
- Property should be sorrounded by mostly quiet regions with natural growth forests preferably. Away from major urban and developed areas.
- Property should not in busy locations or congested areas, high growth-forecasted areas and away from cities and towns preferably.
- Definetely outside in 100mi radius of a big metro.
- Absolutely no HOA or somebody telling me that I cannot dry clothes in the sun, cannot raise chickens or how my yard should look like.

## Property Type
- Land
  - 5-10 acre of land. Can be rural, farm, forest, agricultural. Should have lower taxes. (can go low as 3 acr, if adjoining is forest which is conserved)
  - Should have 60-100% natural wooded / growth trees cover. I see properties where it is convered to pasture by cutting and selling all trees. I need natural growth trees. Even 100% is ok. I can cut/clear what I want.
  - SHould be in a region / adjoining / sorroundings which are away from busy/congested areas. Ideally it will be in a dead-end spot or adjoining forests which are conserved. 
  - Water well should be inspectable and water table / availability should not have problems (i.e historically)
  - Access to reliable electricity (if no services, should be easy or feasbile to get electricity connected)
  - Access to reliable Internet servies
  - ABSOULTELY NO HOA OF ANY SORT. Sub-division agreements or land agreements are OK and can be considered on per-case basis.
  - If has septic tank, should not have any problems
  - Relatively should be off main roads and highways, but the access should be directly to public road (not passing via some other property)
  - No high-volate electric lines running over property 
  - No extremely steep grades on property. 
  - There can be minor flood zones on small portion of land, but this has to be determined on per-case basis.

- Built Space
  - Small, Less than 1500-2000 sft (preferably with -2 car garage, attached or detached)
  - Something not expensive. i.e no fancy stuff. Just bare-minimum. Should be clean and solid.
  - No major structural problems, but I can work with things whose roofing needs to be replaced, some minor or major predictable repairs
  - No mobile homes or semi-mobile homes. 
  - Preferably metal roofing. 
  - Preferably should have outdoor seating spaces.

- Note : 
  - As I have been observing and checking out properties since 2-3 months in this region, I feel there are properties with really big/expensive buildings OR they have mobile homes. So I am open to just look for pure land, either developed or un-developed and I can build somethign simple on it myself slowly.

## Example Properties

Here are some properties I really liked but due to factors, could not close on them : 

- The one I had seen in Dec, but things didn't work out due to me not using a buying agent and the selling agent gamed it to go against my favor : 2500 NE 46th Cir High Springs, FL 32643 (https://www.trulia.com/p/fl/high-springs/2500-ne-46th-cir-high-springs-fl-32643--1002585153) MLS# : 785164

- The land I looked at recently, but didn't work out for Zone AE with land elevation too much difference off the BFE level. 390 NE Castagna Ln, Mayo, FL 32066 | MLS# 119859 | Redfin(https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/390-NE-Castagna-Ln-Mayo-FL-32066/2141550468_zpid/)

## Neighboring / Adjoining Properties

## Constraints
- No HOA
- Should be off major roads. Secluded ok, but not too remote.
- Ideally would be close to or adjoining some state or conservation land which will not have long term change. Like state parks, protected forests. If on the boundary, can consider smaller acerage like 4-5 ac also.

## Price Range
- With built-house around 400-450K (Can be a bit flexible based on real value or future prospects of property)
- Only land (approx 10 ac) : 100-200K (depends on a lot of factors, just setting the range)

## Region
- Northern Florida & a small portion of Sothern Georgia. Prefer/Prioritize FL first and can consider GA (depends on availability, value & likability factors). Currently considering FL for tax purposes. 
- Ideally within 50mi of Talahasssee, FL or Gainesville, FL.
