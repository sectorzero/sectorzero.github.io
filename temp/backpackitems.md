# Backpacking - Packing & Items Planning

## For Ranganath (based on our talk)

## Packing & Items
- [Full Backpack Item List](https://1drv.ms/x/s!Au4_6JRfzLRRnkEhQCpjtOc5AsKd?e=dUPQGH)
    - Has Backpack Items & Hiking Items seperated to calculate backpack weight
    - I have added what I use for guidance. Pick what works for you.
    - **You need to get items marked in orange. Rest is arranged.**

## Food Planning

- For 4 people for 5 day / 4 night backpacking trip
- My food plan, if it works for all is this : 
  - Bfast & Dinner 
    - Common, which needs cooking. Lunch - each get what he wants - which does not need cooking. We will use common stove and pot. This way carry less, one person concentrates on cooking for the rest. Efficient.
    - For Bfast : { Oats, Uphitt, Oats, Uphitt }
    - For Dinner : { Kichdi X 4 }
    - Each of this is lightweight, east-to-cook, only one utensil reqd, nutritious, filling and tasty.
  - Lunch ( which I used last time ) : { Peanuts, Corn-Chips, Dates }. Each person basically gets what they prefer. It should no cooking required though.
- The bear-box will throw some problems. From what I estimated, we will need atleast 2 bear-boxes between 4 of us. So 600g each. Need to estimate food, what we are carrying so that it can fit into the 2 boxes at night. Also they say, keep all food-trash, toothpaste anything that smells in the bear box. Onee option is to use bear boxes for food and hang the rest on a tree. We need prior practice for this this time though.

## Other Discussion

### Sleeping Bag
- I bought this - [Marmot Phase 20](https://www.rei.com/rei-garage/product/174294/marmot-phase-20-sleeping-bag). This was on sale and I'll return it if I don't like it or the REI Magma becomes available. This is supposed to be a really good sleeping bag with a really crappy zip. Hence it is out and next model will probably will have better zip. Long also available.
- Based on my research [REI Magma 15](https://www.rei.com/product/148248/rei-co-op-magma-15-sleeping-bag-mens) is the best bag for weight, money and anything else. It's an eye-shut-and-buy. Nothing comes close.
- Another good product I found, which is a bit heavier, but get's the same functionality at half the price is this. [Elous 15](https://www.hykeandbyke.com/products/eolus-800-fill-power-15-degree-f-down-sleeping-bag). It looks good. REI weight = 800g, This one is 1100. Just FYI for the Hyke&Byke, I see one negative reading reviews. Some few customers got a badly made product. So there is some problem with quality control. If you are considering, call the company and make sure about returns and quality before buying.
- Mistakes to avoid. Last year I bought Nemo Disco 30, which was on clearance for $160. The bag was really crappy and uncomfortable. Nothing good other than low-weight. So I returned it after 2 unsatisfactory uses.
