## Search Process

- First scrape Trulia and other listings for the region and filters required. There will be only stale properties, but that is ok.
- Next drive around exclusively across everywhere. Wherever you see 'for sale' listings get a picture.
- While driving, also x-ref listings to places, you will get an idea of what is good and how much is BS.
- Next pick top 5 of the listing agencies you saw which had advertised in real (by volume, quality etc)
- Go to each of the agencies and designate a buyer agent for you. Ask them to send you all listings which are about to come in and coming in
- Once you like a place, call the specific buyer agent to go see the place. If you like go to Offer
