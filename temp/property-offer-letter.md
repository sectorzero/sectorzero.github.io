Joanne and Michael Daniels,

My name is San and my wife is Shri. We are from the State of Washington. We are in the journey of finding our personal home where we can settle and enjoy the peace. Athough I have worked for many years, I never owned a home. We are in the discovery to find a suitable place where we want to call home and feel blessed.

I have been exploring to find the part of the country to settle down for more than a couple of years now. Recently, we decided that the the region around Northern Florida is where we would like to make our home. I was in a initial process of finding a suitable small piece of land or property when I saw the listing of your property. I always believe that the home has to invite you in, one has to feel the feng-shui, so I dont reserve expectations till I visit the property in person. 

When I visited your property this week, I truly felt a home with a soul. I could feel the Human and American Connection you have built into the place. And I could see how keen an interest and care you have taken in every aspect to make it and call it your home. I cherish this and want to continue to carry that soul in this home. I particularly like the American theme in your living space and would be really inclined to carry the tradition forward and keep the presence of the home the same. Having travelled a lot around the west, I can truly relate to that. 

This home feels just right for Shri and myself where we can finally make a home here and take care of it as you have done so far. We would like to cherish the care you have taken with the natural greens around your space, the delightful porticoes where we can feel the open-ness, feel the warmth of the kitchen and the firepace, feel our feet on the exquisite wooden floors. 

I was always waiting for a home to find me rather than the other way around. We really hope that you choose us to pass on your home for our abode. 

I have worked with Joan to present an offer which I hope will meet your expectations. I am willing to work with you to feel satisfied to let us into your home. One thing which has held me is the relative difficulty of selling this property. Just to hedge this risk, I had requested for a six month lease with option to buy. I respect your reservation of not favoring that option. I hope we can work towards a favorable position. 

I want give you enough evidence that the financing for the property is solid and this will the smoothest part of the process and will have no unknowns from my credit worthiness. To support this I will be providing a pre-approval certification from a lender. Also please note that loan terms will be conventional with 20% down. This should provide you with favourable guarantee from my end.

Also I would like you to know that, if things move forward and we close, you are free to comfortably take your time to make the transition and move out when finally you let us into your home. 

Wishing your family a Happy Christmas and Prosperous 2023

With sincere regards,
