## Kichdi

This is a Kichdi variation made for backpacking. This can be prepped and stored for later use and very easy to cook when needed. This is extermely healthy, has balanced nutrition and has zero problems on your stomach and really tasty.

For a single serving mix : 
- 1/2 of 3/4 cup of rice
- 1/4 of 3/4 cup of masoor dal ( red lentils )
- 1/8 of 3/4 cup of split moong dal
- 1/8 of 3/4 cup of split urad dal
- ( basically it is a mix of 50% rice and 50% lentils. mix and match lentils of your choice, the above ones cook quickly )
- 1/4-1/2 tsp ot turmeric powder
- 1/4 tsp of whole cumin seeds
- 1 cayenne pepper whole
- 1 curry leaf whole
- 1/4-1/2 tsp of fenugreek/methi seeds

- pinch of tamarind ( if you have - not a must )

To cook :
- Add 550ml water to the above mix in a steel pot

- Cook to boil on stove for 20 mins or done 
- At about 15 mins ( or about 75% done ) add 1-2 tsp of ghee and salt to taste
